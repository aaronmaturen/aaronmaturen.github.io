# Galactic Archives Series

_A comprehensive guide to building efficient data sources in Angular using the Star Wars API._

This series explores advanced patterns for handling paginated data in Angular applications. Using the Star Wars API (SWAPI) as our data source, we'll build a robust, reusable solution for displaying and navigating large datasets.

## What You'll Learn

- Creating custom data sources in Angular
- Handling paginated APIs efficiently
- Implementing virtual scrolling
- Managing complex state with RxJS
- Building reusable, testable components

## Table of Contents

### Foundation Phase

1. [Introduction](/musings/post-0-introduction/) - Introduces the DataSource pattern concept and outlines the plan to build a Star Wars data explorer application called "Galactic Archives"
2. [Basic Project Setup](/musings/post-1-basic-project-setup/) - Creates the Angular v18 project with standalone components, sets up Angular Material and Tailwind CSS with `tw-` prefix, and implements a basic app shell
3. [Code Quality Setup](/musings/post-2-code-quality-setup/) - Implements Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality
4. [Testing Setup](/musings/post-3-testing-setup/) - Configures Jest for unit/integration testing and Playwright for E2E testing

### Architecture Phase

5. [Feature-Based Architecture](/musings/post-4-feature-based-architecture/) - Reorganizes the application using a feature-based architecture with core, features, shared, and models directories
6. [Star Wars API Service](/musings/post-5-star-wars-api-service/) - Implements the StarWarsService to interact with the SWAPI API
7. [API Mocking with MSW](/musings/post-6-api-mocking-with-msw/) - Sets up Mock Service Worker for API mocking during development and testing

### Core DataSource Implementation Phase

8. [DataSource Foundation](/musings/post-7-datasource-foundation/) - Implements the core GalacticDataSource class extending Angular's DataSource
9. [Implementing Pagination](/musings/post-8-implementing-pagination/) - Adds pagination to the DataSource and implements MatTable with MatPaginator
10. [Adding Sorting](/musings/post-9-adding-sorting/) - Enhances the DataSource with sorting capabilities using MatSort
11. [Implementing Filtering](/musings/post-10-implementing-filtering/) - Adds filtering functionality to the DataSource with debouncing

### UI Enhancement Phase

12. [Star Wars Theming](/musings/post-11-star-wars-theming/) - Customizes the Angular Material theme with Star Wars-inspired colors
13. [Responsive Design](/musings/post-12-responsive-design/) - Makes the application fully responsive across different device sizes
14. [Keyboard Navigation](/musings/post-13-keyboard-navigation/) - Improves accessibility with keyboard navigation support
15. [High Contrast Mode](/musings/post-14-high-contrast-mode/) - Adds support for high contrast mode for visually impaired users
16. [Loading States and UX](/musings/post-15-loading-states-and-ux/) - Enhances user experience with better loading states and indicators

### Testing and Deployment Phase

17. [Testing DataSource](/musings/post-16-testing-datasource/) - Implements comprehensive tests for the DataSource using Jest and MSW
18. [Deployment Optimization](/musings/post-17-deployment-optimization/) - Optimizes the application for production with bundle analysis, service worker implementation, and advanced caching
19. [CI/CD with GitHub Actions](/musings/post-18-cicd-with-github-actions/) - Sets up continuous integration and deployment pipelines
20. [Future Directions and Advanced Patterns](/musings/post-19-future-directions/) - Explores hypothetical improvements including Angular Signals, NgRx integration, advanced caching strategies, and performance optimizations

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Angular and TypeScript
- Familiarity with RxJS observables
- Understanding of HTTP client operations

## Project Evolution Overview

This document provides an analysis of the blog post series, demonstrating how each post builds incrementally on the previous one to create a complete Angular application implementing the DataSource pattern with the Star Wars API.

Join me on this journey through the galaxy of Angular data management, where we'll tackle common challenges and build solutions that you can apply to your own projects.
